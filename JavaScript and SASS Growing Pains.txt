<h1 class="text-center red-text">My Time So Far Studying JavaScript and SASS(SCSS syntax)</h1>
h1{background-color: silver;}
<p1>Currently I'm proficient in basic HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and jQuery.
 I'm not really sure how to get preprocessors, libraries, and frameworks
  to work on Visual Code yet so this is written without them.
   Anyway, this now makes my fifth week of building projects out of code.
   Not only did I find it was getting too easy just using what I already knew . . .
   I found that to get even a basic entry level front end developer job will
   require more knowledge and skills than I currently have at my disposal. </p1>

  <p2 class="purple-text">So I decided to delve into SASS and JavaScript. 
   I figured it'd be freaking hard. No doubt about that. Still, it was rather
   dumb of me to think JavaScript would 
   be easier because jQuery is written in it. In some respects that's true if 
   you consider basic syntax. But the moment you start touching on JavaScript's
   finer details like variables let alone object oriented programming you'll 
   see just how wrong I really was. I'm not anywhere near programming yet and
   this is how things stand. Heh. I'm fine with that. If there were no challenge
   it wouldn't be fun to conquer anyway. SASS, however, is far easier. It's just
   a more streamlined version of CSS that gets rid of the traditional repititions
   you normally see. At the rate I'm going I'll learn the basics of SASS in two 
   weeks tops. I should get through JavaScript in two months tops.

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <p3>Once I do, I'll then be capable of not just basic web design but some programming as well. 
   Then I'll be able create a Code Wars account where I can then spend time solving
   programming problems rather than just learning a bunch of theory. Granted the 
   theory helps me know why something works by conceptually deconstructing it
   for my understanding. But it's not enough if you're not putting it into active,
   practical use building web pages and writing your own programs. 
   So when I finish up with SASS I'll drop my plans for the time being to pick up
   ReactJS and focus everything on JavaScript. Meanwhile I'll be putting the SASS I'll
   have learned to use in my CodePen projects. Doing that should make it six weeks at 
   most for me to learn SASS and JavaScript. Then after a few projects integrating
   both JavaScript and SASS I should be able to land my first freelance job off CodePen.
   So my hopes and expectations for myself are high because I know I can achieve it.</p3>
